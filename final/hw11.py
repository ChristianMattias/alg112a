Hilbert's Dream:
1. Hilbert's Tenth Problem (1900):
In the year 1900, David Hilbert presented a list of 23 unsolved problems during a famous address at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris.
Hilbert's tenth problem was particularly intriguing: He asked whether there exists a general algorithm to determine whether a given Diophantine equation (a polynomial equation with integer coefficients) has an integer solution.

2. Hilbert's Dream of Formalization:
Hilbert believed in the formalization of all of mathematics, envisioning a complete and consistent set of axioms from which all mathematical truths could be derived.
His program aimed to prove the consistency and completeness of formal systems and to find an algorithmic method for solving mathematical problems.
Turing's Contribution:
    
3. Alan Turing and the Turing Machine (1936):
In 1936, Alan Turing introduced the concept of a universal computing machine, now known as the Turing machine.
Turing demonstrated that a universal Turing machine could simulate any other Turing machine, leading to the idea of a universal algorithmic procedure.

4. The Halting Problem (1936):
Turing also formulated the Halting Problem, proving that there is no general algorithm to determine, given an arbitrary description of an arbitrary computer program and an input, whether the program will eventually halt.

5. Undecidability and Incompleteness:
Turing's work, along with Kurt GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems, shattered Hilbert's dream of a complete and consistent set of axioms.
Undecidability and incompleteness showed that certain mathematical truths cannot be proven within a formal system, and some problems are algorithmically unsolvable.
Development of Complexity Theory:

6. P vs NP (1971):
Stephen Cook introduced the concept of NP-completeness in his seminal paper "The Complexity of Theorem-Proving Procedures."
Cook presented the first NP-complete problem, known as SAT (Boolean satisfiability problem), and established the notion of polynomial-time reductions.

7. NP-Complete Problems (1971):
Leonid Levin independently discovered NP-completeness, and the class NP (nondeterministic polynomial time) was introduced.
Cook's and Levin's work laid the foundation for complexity theory, suggesting that certain problems might not have efficient algorithms.

8. P vs NP Problem:
The question of whether P (problems solvable in polynomial time) equals NP (problems verifiable in polynomial time) remains one of the most famous open problems in computer science.
The Clay Mathematics Institute includes the P vs NP problem in its list of seven Millennium Prize Problems.
